# UFOs

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to create a dynamic web page that accepts user input and dynamically displays information on UFO sightings. Users will be able to filter the UFO sightings table by several criteria, including the event date, city, state, country, and shape, in order to conduct their analysis.

The table will dynamically update itself when one of the criteria is changed. The result will be that each user can conduct their analysis on the data at hand, while allowing other researchers to filter by their own parameters. For example, one researcher may want to see UFO sightings where the shape was 'circle'. Another researcher may want to only see sightings where the date was on an important event. This dynamic functionality will allow for a wide range of research possibilities.

## Using The Website For Research

Our client will be able to see the introductory and title section with the picture in the top as they scroll down, which will continue to reveal all of the data and filters that we have (which is shown below). We have five distinct filters from this image; date, city, state, country & shape. You may utilize the filters by entering search criteria into the field and then press "Enter" on your keyboard to activate the filter.

#### Filter by Date

Users will be able to filter by date to see any UFO sightings on a particular date.

#### Filter by State

Users can also filter by state.

## Summary

While the use of multiple fields for filters is a welcome addition the removal of the button does present user friction.

We do suggest either re-establishment of a button or written instructions to use the "Enter" button upon filling out a field.

A secondary issue we run into is around case-sensitivy. All data is presented in lower case even while using formal names like city names and state abbreviations. It is our recommendation to create a search funcationality that addresses this issue.
